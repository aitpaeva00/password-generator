# Password Generator

## Project Description

The **Password Generator** is a Java-based program that generates secure and customizable passwords based on user-defined criteria. The program allows the user to specify the desired length and types of characters (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters) in the generated password. Additionally, the program evaluates the strength of the generated password using a predefined algorithm, giving the user feedback on its strength (weak, medium, or strong).

The project also includes the ability to read from and write to files. Users can save their generated passwords into a `.txt` file and read from previously generated passwords.

## Design Choices

- **User Input**: The program uses a console-based interface where the user can specify the length of the password, the types of characters to include, and whether they want to define a custom character set.
- **Password Generation**: The password is generated by randomly selecting characters from the specified sets. The length of the password is randomly determined within the given minimum and maximum range.
- **Password Strength Evaluation**: The strength of the password is evaluated based on its length and complexity. A simple strength evaluation algorithm is used here, but for future improvements, an integration with **zxcvbn** (a password strength evaluation library) can be added.
- **File Handling**: The program saves the generated password to a `.txt` file using basic file handling in Java. This is an optional feature and can be skipped if not required by the user.

## Algorithms and Data Structures Used

- **Random Selection**: The password is generated by randomly selecting characters from the defined sets using Java's `Random` class.
- **StringBuilder**: The `StringBuilder` class is used to efficiently construct the password string. This is especially useful for handling larger strings since it allows for modifications without creating new string objects each time.
- **BufferedWriter**: The `BufferedWriter` class is used to write the generated password to a file in a simple text format.
- **String Operations**: The program uses string concatenation to build the character set based on user choices and generates passwords by randomly picking characters from the set.

## Challenges Encountered

- **Validating User Input**: Ensuring that the user inputs valid values for the password length and character selection was one of the challenges. To improve the user experience, input validation and error handling should be added.
- **Password Strength Evaluation**: Initially, the strength of the password was determined only by length. This could be expanded to include more sophisticated checks, such as diversity of characters and entropy.
- **File Handling**: File I/O operations had to be implemented carefully to avoid overwriting files unintentionally. Additional features, such as appending to files or selecting a file name, could be considered in future versions.

## Improvements Made

- **Custom Character Set**: An improvement over the basic implementation was the addition of a custom character set. This allows users to enter their own set of characters, making the password generator more flexible.
- **Password Strength Evaluation**: While initially the strength was simply evaluated based on length, the evaluation logic could be expanded to consider character variety, length, and entropy.

## Input and Output Files

- **Input Files**: The program does not require any input files for generating passwords, though custom character sets can be entered by the user at runtime.
- **Output Files**: The generated passwords can be saved to an output file (`password.txt`). This file stores the generated password for later use or reference. The file is saved in the same directory as the program unless otherwise specified by the user.

## Example Output

The program generates the password according to the user's specifications and evaluates its strength. Here is an example of how the program works:
